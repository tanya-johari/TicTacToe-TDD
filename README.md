# TDDing Tic Tac Toe Game in React

Here's how to start the Tic-Tac-Toe project from the command line, assuming you have Node.js and npm (or yarn) installed:

## 1. Project Setup:

- Clone or Download the Repository (if applicable).
- Install Dependencies:
Install the required dependencies using npm or yarn:
Bash
#### Using npm
```npm install```
#### Using yarn
```yarn install```

This will download and install all the necessary libraries (@testing-library/react, @testing-library/user-event, and cypress for testing) specified in your project's package.json file.

- Run the Development Server:
If your project has a development server set up, you can typically start it using a script in your package.json file. The exact command might vary depending on your project setup, but it's often something like:
Bash
#### Using npm
```npm start```

#### Using yarn
```yarn start```

This will usually start a local server (e.g., on port 3000) where you can access your application in a web browser.

- Run Tests:
#### Jest Tests:
To execute unit tests with Jest, run:
```npm test```
      or
```yarn test```

#### Cypress Tests:
To initiate Cypress end-to-end tests, run:
```yarn cypress```

This will open the Cypress test runner in your browser, allowing you to view test results visually.
